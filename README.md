# Switch2Zero Engineering Challenge

This project contains both a frontend and a backend component. The frontend is built using React with Vite, while the backend is an Express.js server.

## Project Notes

For the table functionalities in the frontend, I've used `@tanstack/react-table` as opposed to `react-bootstrap-table2` because the latter was not compatible with the most recent version of React.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm

### Backend (Express.js)

Navigate to the `server` folder to work with the backend. The data souce is contained in a file called mockData.ts

#### Installation

```bash
cd server
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Frontend (React)

Navigate to the `client` folder to work with the frontend.

#### Installation

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```
